# Remember Tracks
### Connect your memory, location and tracks.
- **This is a test angularjs app for personal learning**
- **Still not deplyed anywhere.**
- Use this app where you want to save the track when you happen to be reminded of.
  - Search music by artist name, album name, anything. Find what you are looking for.
  - Tap the headphone icon to confirm the track is what you are reminded of.
  - If the music is all right, tap star icon.
  - The track is saved to localstorage with the current position.
    - Will be stored on server(some day)
  - Style is not perfect, sorry...
